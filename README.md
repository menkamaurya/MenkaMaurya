I have 7 years of extensive experience in BASEL II, regulatory compliance, enterprise risk management, business analysis, and quality assurance testing. I hold a graduate degree in Enterprise Risk Management from St. John's University, New York. I have also researched and published whitepapers on regulatory compliance and enterprise risk management. My technical skills include proficiency in Excel, Access, SQL, and risk management software such as SAS, SPSS, and @RISK.
